# advent_of_code_2020
Complete solutions implementation of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) (AOC) coding problems.

The challenge lasts 25 days from 1st to 25th of December. Each day a new problem is made available, with two parts.

Problems were solved daily during the advent period, then cleaned up slightly for publication.

I used the AOC challenge to consolidate my Python programming language skills, explore more advanced Python concepts and improve algorithmic thinking and implementation efficiency.

For some challenges I deemed appropriate to give up on some efficiency for code readability and clarity. Asymptotic running time efficiency has nevertheless been one major concern throughout the challenge, allowing me to reach optimally efficient solutions for most problems.

The solutions to the simplest problems present both parts in a single file. Whenever major reformatting was needed to adapt the solution to part 2, I coded it from scratch in a separate part2 file.

Each solution is given as a runnable python script featuring a `main` function. First step in each problem is ad hoc input parsing. Coherent functional blocks are then organized into functions as to render code reusable as well as more readable, organized and interpretable. Type hinting was used to explicit types and improve code quality. Finally, intermediate assertions, code testing and prints were removed ahead of publication.
